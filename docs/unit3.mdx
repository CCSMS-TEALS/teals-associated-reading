## 3.1

### Function calls
In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. We have already seen one example of a function call:
```python
>>> type(32)
<type 'int'="">
```

The name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument.

It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is called the return value.

### Type conversion functions
Python provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:
```python
>>> int('32')
32
>>> int('Hello')
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello
```

int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the fraction part:
```python
>>> int(3.99999)
3
>>> int(-2.3)
-2
```

float converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:
```python
>>> float(32)
32.0
>>> float('3.14159')
3.14159
```

Finally, str converts its argument to a string:
```python
>>> str(32)
'32'
>>> str(3.14159)
'3.14159'
```

### Math functions
Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A module is a file that contains a collection of related functions.

Before we can use the module, we have to import it:
```python
>>> import math
```

This statement creates a module object named math.
If you print the module object, you get some information about it:
```python
>>> print(math)
<module 'math'="" (built-in)="">
```

The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation.
```python
>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power
>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
>>> radians = 0.7
>>> height = math.sin(radians)
```

The first example uses log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that signal_power and noise_power are defined). The math module also provides log, which computes logarithms base e.

The second example finds the sine of radians. The name of the variable is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric functions (cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2π:
```python
>>> degrees = 45
>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi
>>> math.sin(radians)
0.707106781187
```

The expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of this variable is an approximation of π, accurate to about 15 digits.

If you know your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two divided by two:
```python
>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0
0.707106781187
```

### Composition
So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and statements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and compose them. For example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression, including arithmetic operators:
```python
x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)
```

And even function calls:
```python
x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))
```

Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later).
```python
>>> minutes = hours * 60                 # right
>>> hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
```

## 3.2
### Adding new functions
So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.

Here is an example:
```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
```

def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any arguments.

The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.

The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.

If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses to let you know that the definition isn’t complete:
```python
>>> def print_lyrics():
...     print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
...     print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
...
```

To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a script). Defining a function creates a variable with the same name.
```python
>>> print(print_lyrics)
<function print_lyrics="" at="" 0xb7e99e9c="">
>>> type(print_lyrics)
<type 'function'="">
```
The value of print_lyrics is a function object, which has type 'function'. The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:
```python
>>> print_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
```

Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called repeat_lyrics:
```python
def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()
```
And then call repeat_lyrics:
```python
>>> repeat_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
```

But that’s not really how the song goes.

### Definitions and uses
Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:
```python
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()
```

This program contains two function definitions: print_lyrics and repeat_lyrics. Function definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements inside the function do not get executed until the function is called, and the function definition generates no output.

As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the first time it is called.

#### Exercise 3.1
Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.

#### Exercise 3.2
Move the function call back to the bottom and move the definition of print_lyrics after the definition of repeat_lyrics. What happens when you run this program?

### Flow of execution
In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the flow of execution.

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.

Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.

A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.

That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function!

Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.

What’s the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution.

### Parameters and arguments
Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call math.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.

Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters. Here is an example of a user-defined function that takes an argument:
```python
def print_twice(bruce):
    print(bruce)
    print(bruce)
```
This function assigns the argument to a parameter named Bruce. When the function is called, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice.

This function works with any value that can be printed.
```python
>>> print_twice('Spam')
Spam
Spam
>>> print_twice(17)
17
17
>>> print_twice(math.pi)
3.14159265359
3.14159265359
```
The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to user-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression as an argument for print_twice:
```python
>>> print_twice('Spam '*4)
Spam Spam Spam Spam
Spam Spam Spam Spam
>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))
-1.0
-1.0
```
The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the expressions 'Spam '*4 and math.cos(math.pi) are only evaluated once.

You can also use a variable as an argument:
```python
>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'
>>> print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.
```
The name of the variable we pass as an argument (Michael) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (Bruce). It doesn’t matter what the value was called back home (in the caller); here in print_twice, we call everybody Bruce.

## 3.3
### Return values
Some of the built-in functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce results. Calling the function generates a value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.
```python
e = math.exp(1.0)
height = radius * math.sin(radians)
```
All of the functions we have written so far are void; they print something or move turtles around, but their return value is None.

In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions. The first example is area, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:
```python
def area(radius):
    temp = math.pi * radius**2
    return temp
```
This statement means: “Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.” The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely:
```python
def area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius**2
```
On the other hand, temporary variables like temp often make debugging easier.

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a conditional:
```python
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    else:
        return x
```

Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional, only one will be executed.

As soon as a return statement executes, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. Code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the flow of execution can never reach, is called dead code.

It is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the program hits a return statement. For example:
```python
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    if x > 0:
        return x
```
This function is incorrect because if x happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a return statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end of a function, the return value is None, which is not the absolute value of 0.
```python
>>> print(absolute_value(0))
None
```
By the way, Python provides a built-in function called abs that computes absolute values.

#### Exercise 3.3
Write a compare function that returns 1 if x > y, 0 if x == y, and −1 if x < y.

## 3.4
### Aliasing
If a refers to an object and you assign b = a, then both variables refer to the same object:
```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> b is a
True
```

The association of a variable with an object is called a reference. In this example, there are two references to the same object.

An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is aliased.

If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:
```python
>>> b[0] = 17
>>> print(a)
[17, 2, 3]
```

Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.

### Variables and parameters are local
When you create a variable inside a function, it is local, which means that it only exists inside the function. For example:
```python
def cat_twice(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print_twice(cat)
```
This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints the result twice. Here is an example that uses it:
```python
>>> line1 = 'Bing tiddle '
>>> line2 = 'tiddle bang.'
>>> cat_twice(line1, line2)
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.
```
When cat_twice terminates, the variable cat is destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an exception:
```python
>>> print(cat)
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
```
Parameters are also local. For example, outside print_twice, there is no such thing as Bruce.

### Global variables
Variables created outside the function, so it belongs to the special frame called __main__. Variables in __main__ are sometimes called global because they can be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their function ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.

It is common to use global variables for constants; that is, variables that do not change. For example, some programs use constants to indicate the minimum or maximum number of a dataset like the max level of a game could be set to 10.

If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised. The following example is supposed to keep track of whether the function has been called:
```python
been_called = False

def example2():
    been_called = True         # WRONG
```
But if you run it you will see that the value of been_called doesn’t change. The problem is that example2 creates a new local variable named been_called. The local variable goes away when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.

To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to declare the global variable before you use it:
```python
been_called = False

def example2():
    global been_called
    been_called = True
```
The global statement tells the interpreter something like, “In this function, when I say been_called, I mean the global variable; don’t create a local one.”

Here’s an example that tries to update a global variable:
```python
count = 0

def example3():
    count = count + 1          # WRONG
```

If you run it you get the following error message:
```python
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment
```

Python assumes that count is local, and under that assumption you are reading it before writing it. The solution, again, is to declare count global.
```python
def example3():
    global count
    count += 1
```
If a global variable refers to a mutable value, you can modify the value without declaring the variable global:
```python
known = [10, 20]

def example4():
    known[1] = 30
```

If a program has a lot of global variables and are modify them frequently, they can make programs hard to debug.

### Stack diagrams
To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a stack diagram. Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the function to which each variable belongs.

Each function is represented by a frame. A frame is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for the previous example looks like this:



<CenteredDiv>
  <img alt="Figure 3.1 - A depiction of the stack diagram" src={'http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/courses/cs21book/build/_images/stack.png'} />
  <p>Stack diagram</p>
</CenteredDiv>

The order of the stack shows the flow of execution. print_twice was called by cat_twice, and cat_twice was called by __main__, which is a special name for the topmost function. When you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to __main__.

Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, part1 has the same value as chant1, part2 has the same value as chant2, and param has the same value as cat.

If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, and the name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that called that, all the way back to the top most function.

To see how this works, create a Python script named tryme2.py that looks like this:
```python
def print_twice(param):
    print(param)
    print(param)
    print(cat)

def cat_twice(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print_twice(cat)

chant1 = "Pie Jesu domine, "
chant2 = "Dona eis requim."
cat_twice(chant1, chant2)
```

We’ve added the statement, print(cat) inside the print_twice function, but cat is not defined there. Running this script will produce an error message like this:
```python
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "tryme2.py", line 12, in <module>
    cat_twice(chant1, chant2)
  File "tryme2.py", line 8, in cat_twice
    print_twice(cat)
  File "tryme2.py", line 4, in print_twice
    print(cat)
NameError: global name 'cat' is not defined
```

This list of functions is called a traceback. It tells you what program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that caused the error.

Notice the similarity between the traceback and the stack diagram. It’s not a coincidence. In fact, another common name for a traceback is a stack trace.

### List arguments
When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the change. For example, delete_head removes the first element from a list:
```python
def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]
```

Here’s how it is used:
```python
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> delete_head(letters)
>>> print(letters)
['b', 'c']
```
The parameter t and the variable letters are aliases for the same object. The stack diagram looks like the following:

  <img alt="Figure 3.2 - A depiction of the stack diagram" src={'http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython017.png'} />
  <p>Stack diagram</p>
</CenteredDiv>
Since the list is shared by two frames, I drew it between them.

It is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that create new lists. For example, the append method modifies a list, but the + operator creates a new list:
```python
>>> t1 = [1, 2]
>>> t2 = t1.append(3)
>>> print(t1)
[1, 2, 3]
>>> print(t2)
None

>>> t3 = t1 + [4]
>>> print(t3)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists. For example, this function does not delete the head of a list:
```python
def bad_delete_head(t):
    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!
```

The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes t refer to it, but none of that has any effect on the list that was passed as an argument.

An alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, tail returns all but the first element of a list:
```python
def tail(t):
    return t[1:]
```
This function leaves the original list unmodified. Here’s how it is used:
```python
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> rest = tail(letters)
>>> print(rest)
['b', 'c']
```
